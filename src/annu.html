Prompt to resume tomorrow:

Hey ChatGPT, yesterday we set up the deal-seeker project and fixed some environment issues.

Node.js was missing, so I planned to install it to run npm run dev.

The next steps are: confirm Node.js install, run the dev server, and then continue replacing config files (tsconfig.json, index.html, src/index.css) and creating core files.
Please remind me where we stopped and help continue step-by-step.
